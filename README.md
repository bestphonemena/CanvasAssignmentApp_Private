# CanvasAssignmentApp_Private
A browserless interface with Canvas that allows direct, listed appending of assignment to target categories.

As the Canvas login requires an API key, first please save your unique Canvas API key directly to a .txt file in a directory accesible by the Assignment Maker.
The dataSaver.py needs to be run first to retrieve and generate your information and course listings, assignment groups, etc.
Once this is complete, launch Assignment Maker. 

*Using the "Update Course Information" function runs DataSaver again and overwirites current class data with updated values. 
*As learning module naming conventions change depending on institution, please adjust the string searches in "CanvasFunctions" accordingly.
